            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>When I first read about web3 I knew it was a game-changer. Secure, public, and equitable transactions
            using crowd-sourced computing resources seemed attractive to me in its modernist spirit. So naturally I began to explore.
            When I used web3 for the first time, browsing the Solana apps with my phantom wallet, I was amazed to find that many of those optimistic articles
            that introduced me to web3 had made very accurate claims about the egalitarian nature of these decentralized apps, and the Solana platform in general. 
            Information was free to the public by way of blockchain data apps like Solscan, and organizations could be funded and governed by gatherings of passionate
            developers and users. I did not know what exactly I had stumbled upon, but I knew it was a triumph of humanity and technology.</p>

            <h2>The Wild Frontier</h2>
            <p>As I enjoyed exploring Solana, I started to notice a seeming obsession with the financial applications of the platform. On all of the
            socials anyone who stamped a #Solana in their post, appeared to be selling something. I began to investigate some of the trending Solana tokens
            and started to see 10,000%+ returns on dozens of these hyper-obscure coins. Some of the coins appeared to be useful, with app integrations and
            publically present creators and developers. Others claimed to be fun, celebrating that we had found this beautiful ecosystem and that we ought to
            treat it like a printing press. Most coins, however, had only a picture and a name with a couple thousand dollars worth of liquidity on raydium.
            These were and still are the most dangerous coins. I lost a couple hundred dollars to a few of these coins, but I've seen others lose thousands.
            And for Solana cowboys, it's not a big deal, we know it is a frontier with abundant opportunities and even more abundant dangers, but can the community
            survive as a primal pool of risk-takers forever?</p>

            <h2>Yada's vision</h2>
            <p>I quickly became exhausted by the charts and the endless shilling and decided to do something about the depressing climate of such a promising platform,
            So I founded Yada with my close friend Thum. We want Solana to keep its cyber-arcadian charm, and we support the idea of creating capital through projects on Solana. But we want to focus on
            the projects that matter; The projects that will stick around for another decade, and likely provide a service greater than making coin scalpers rich.
            A service or good that is more important than any one person's financial interest. Those projects should be nourished. That is our vision. </p>
